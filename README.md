# Donatic
A Platform for Donations on Polygon that is Decentralized (currently operational on mumbai testnet).

NGOs have the ability to enroll via our website by providing information such as their Name, wallet address, and their field of work, for example, Health, Education, or Environment.
We will authenticate the NGO by verifying their assigned NGO registration ID.
The wallet address of the NGO will be added in the smart contract within their respective field. When a user selects a category, enters an amount to donate, and clicks the send button, the amount will be transferred to the balance of that particular category. Once the threshold balance is reached within that category, the total amount will be evenly distributed among all the NGOs registered under that specific category.

## HOW TO USE

1. Access our website [here](https://0xmihirsahu.github.io/Donatic/)

2. Launch the [metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension and switch the network to Polygon (presently mumbai testnet)

3. Tap on the Connect Wallet button located on the right-hand side of the navigation bar.

4. Connect your wallet.

5. Scroll downwards and choose the category corresponding to the sector of NGOs you wish to contribute to.

6. Input the desired amount in Matic that you intend to donate.

7. Select the Send button.

8. Validate the transaction using your metamask.

9. Once the transaction is successfully completed, a pop-up window will appear displaying a message of success along with the tx hash.

## Whats next ?

In the future, we will be adding a dedicated section on our platform dedicated to showcasing the activities of the NGOs that are registered on it. This section will provide the NGOs with a platform to showcase their work to potential donors and volunteers. We will also provide an easy-to-use interface for the NGOs to update their activities in real-time.
